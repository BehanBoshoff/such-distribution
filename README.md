#probability_distributions package

This is a package which does many wonderful things that normal people have no interest in whatsoever, such as adding Gaussian and Binomial Distributions together.
If you count yourself amongst them, then all you need to know is:

'Python code big good.'

Alternatively, you can install this package from PyPI using the command 'pip install suchdistribution'.
Enjoy!
